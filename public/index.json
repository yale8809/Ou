[{"content":"How I Built This Website with Hugo and GitHub Pages Building a personal website doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complicated or expensive. In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share how I created this site using Hugo, a fast static site generator, and deployed it for free using GitHub Pages.\nWhy Hugo? After researching various options, I chose Hugo for several reasons:\nSpeed: Hugo builds sites incredibly fast Simplicity: Write content in Markdown Flexibility: Highly customizable with themes Free hosting: Perfect for GitHub Pages No database: Static files are secure and fast The Tech Stack Here\u0026rsquo;s what powers this website:\nCore Technologies Hugo: Static site generator PaperMod Theme: Clean, responsive design Markdown: Easy content creation GitHub Actions: Automated deployment GitHub Pages: Free hosting Development Tools Git: Version control VS Code: Code editing Terminal: Command line operations Step-by-Step Setup 1. Install Hugo sudo snap install hugo 2. Create New Site hugo new site my-website cd my-website 3. Add Theme git init git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod 4. Configure Hugo Update hugo.toml with your site configuration:\nbaseURL = \u0026#39;https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/\u0026#39; languageCode = \u0026#39;en-us\u0026#39; title = \u0026#39;Your Website Title\u0026#39; theme = \u0026#39;PaperMod\u0026#39; [params] env = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Your site description\u0026#34; # ... more configuration 5. Create Content hugo new content about.md hugo new content posts/my-first-post.md 6. Test Locally hugo server --buildDrafts 7. Setup GitHub Actions Create .github/workflows/hugo.yml for automatic deployment.\nKey Features I Added Navigation Menu Created a clear navigation structure with:\nAbout page Career section Team information Blog posts Content Organization Structured content in logical directories Used front matter for metadata Implemented tags and categories SEO Optimization Descriptive titles and meta descriptions Proper heading structure Social media integration Deployment Process The deployment is fully automated:\nPush to GitHub: Any commit to main branch triggers deployment GitHub Actions: Builds the site using Hugo GitHub Pages: Serves the static files Benefits of This Setup Cost Effective $0/month: Everything is free No server maintenance No database costs Performance Lightning fast load times CDN distribution via GitHub Pages Optimized static files Maintenance No security updates needed No server monitoring Simple backup (just git repository) Developer Experience Write in Markdown Version controlled content Local development server Automated deployment Lessons Learned What Worked Well Hugo\u0026rsquo;s build speed is impressive PaperMod theme is well-documented GitHub Actions deployment is reliable Markdown content creation is enjoyable Challenges Initial theme customization took time Understanding Hugo\u0026rsquo;s directory structure Configuring proper base URLs for GitHub Pages Would I Do It Again? Absolutely! This setup provides excellent developer experience with minimal overhead.\nNext Steps Future improvements I\u0026rsquo;m considering:\nAdding search functionality Implementing comment system Creating custom shortcodes Adding analytics integration Resources If you want to create a similar setup:\nHugo Documentation PaperMod Theme GitHub Pages Guide This site\u0026rsquo;s source code Building this website was a rewarding experience that combines modern web development practices with simplicity. The result is a fast, maintainable, and cost-effective personal platform.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/Ou/posts/setting-up-hugo-website/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"how-i-built-this-website-with-hugo-and-github-pages\"\u003eHow I Built This Website with Hugo and GitHub Pages\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding a personal website doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complicated or expensive.
