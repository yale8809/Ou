# How I Built This Website with Hugo and GitHub Pages

Building a personal website doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. In this post, I'll share how I created this site using Hugo, a fast static site generator, and deployed it for free using GitHub Pages.

## Why Hugo?

After researching various options, I chose Hugo for several reasons:

- **Speed**: Hugo builds sites incredibly fast
- **Simplicity**: Write content in Markdown
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable with themes
- **Free hosting**: Perfect for GitHub Pages
- **No database**: Static files are secure and fast

## The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this website:

### Core Technologies
- **Hugo**: Static site generator
- **PaperMod Theme**: Clean, responsive design
- **Markdown**: Easy content creation
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control
- **VS Code**: Code editing
- **Terminal**: Command line operations

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Hugo
```bash
sudo snap install hugo
```

### 2. Create New Site
```bash
hugo new site my-website
cd my-website
```

### 3. Add Theme
```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
```

### 4. Configure Hugo
Update `hugo.toml` with your site configuration:

```toml
baseURL = 'https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'Your Website Title'
theme = 'PaperMod'

[params]
  env = "production"
  description = "Your site description"
  # ... more configuration
```

### 5. Create Content
```bash
hugo new content about.md
hugo new content posts/my-first-post.md
```

### 6. Test Locally
```bash
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

### 7. Setup GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` for automatic deployment.

## Key Features I Added

### Navigation Menu
Created a clear navigation structure with:
- About page
- Career section  
- Team information
- Blog posts

### Content Organization
- Structured content in logical directories
- Used front matter for metadata
- Implemented tags and categories

### SEO Optimization
- Descriptive titles and meta descriptions
- Proper heading structure
- Social media integration

## Deployment Process

The deployment is fully automated:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Any commit to main branch triggers deployment
2. **GitHub Actions**: Builds the site using Hugo
3. **GitHub Pages**: Serves the static files

## Benefits of This Setup

### Cost Effective
- **$0/month**: Everything is free
- No server maintenance
- No database costs

### Performance
- Lightning fast load times
- CDN distribution via GitHub Pages
- Optimized static files

### Maintenance
- No security updates needed
- No server monitoring
- Simple backup (just git repository)

### Developer Experience
- Write in Markdown
- Version controlled content
- Local development server
- Automated deployment

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Hugo's build speed is impressive
- PaperMod theme is well-documented
- GitHub Actions deployment is reliable
- Markdown content creation is enjoyable

### Challenges
- Initial theme customization took time
- Understanding Hugo's directory structure
- Configuring proper base URLs for GitHub Pages

### Would I Do It Again?
Absolutely! This setup provides excellent developer experience with minimal overhead.

## Next Steps

Future improvements I'm considering:
